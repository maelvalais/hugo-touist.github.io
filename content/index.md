We can for example conveniently express and solve problems such as "Wolf, Sheep, Cabbage", or the sudoku.

The team behind TouIST consists of [Frédéric Maris][fred] (Associate
Professor),   [Olivier Gasquet][olivier] (Full Professor),   [Dominique
Longin][domi] (Research Scientist) and   [Maël Valais][mael] (PhD
student) at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse
([IRIT]). It is a "second" or "new" version of a previous program,
SAToulouse. TouIST is now actively developed in context of Maël Valais'
PhD thesis.
